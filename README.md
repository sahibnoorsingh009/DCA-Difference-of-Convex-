# DC Optimization Visualization

An interactive web-based visualization of the Difference of Convex (DC) function optimization algorithm.

## Live Demo
Visit: `https://yourusername.github.io/dc-optimization-visualization`

## About
This visualization demonstrates how the DC Algorithm works using the example function:
**f(x) = xÂ² - |x|**

### Features
- Step-by-step algorithm progression
- Interactive controls
- Mathematical explanations
- Responsive design

### Algorithm Steps
1. **Linearize**: Replace h(x) = |x| with linear approximation
2. **Solve**: Minimize the convex approximation
3. **Update**: Move to the minimum point
4. **Repeat**: Continue until convergence

## Technical Details
- Pure JavaScript implementation
- Chart.js for visualization
- No build process required
- Mobile-friendly design

## Usage for Thesis
This visualization is designed to help explain DC optimization concepts in academic presentations and thesis work.
